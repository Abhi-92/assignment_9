    \section{Problem Statement}
  \end{center}
  \begin{small}      
    \begin{itemize}
     \item In this assignment we have to analyze a data file on the basis of different emoticons and words that reflect emotions. A dictionary is
     given beforehand relation each emoticon to its correpsonding emotion. In this assignment we have to count the percentage of occurence of each emoticon
     and also find out the mood of each user on the basis of the emoticons he has used the most in his/her conversation. The chat file and the 
     dicitonary have to be pulled from a github account. The output file containing the percentage of usage of each emoticon and user mood has to be pushed as well on the github account.\\
    \end{itemize}
  \end{small}

    \section{Assumptions}
  \end{center}
  \begin{small}
    1) Only one emoticon is present in each line.\\
    2) The contec\nt.txt file is present in the same directory as the pyhon script file.\\
  \end{small}

    \section{Explanation of Logic}
  \end{center}

  \begin{small}
    1) Uniq -c searches the specified input file for consecutive duplicate lines and prefix those lines with a number
       representing how many times they occurred.\\
    \\2) Sort command sort lines of this new text files in the numerical order.\\
    \\3) Sort Uniq combination sorts the file into the order of the number of occurrences of each line in the file.\\
    \\4) Grep -v searches the input files or standard input for lines not matching to the given pattern or string.\\
    \\5) Once the sorted list is obtained then according to the user choice that is entered as command line input, 
	 and according to that choice the first 'x' or the last 'x' enteries will be displayed.\\
    \\6) For top 'x' enteries, sort -rn is used which sorts in descending order i.e. maximum occuring word comes 
	 first and least occuring word comes at last. For bottom 'x' enteries, sort -n is used which sorts in ascending 
	 order i.e. minimum occuring word comes first and maximum occuring word comes at last.\\
